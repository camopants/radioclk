        * placeholder for additional notes, in a separate file, on running 
	successfully on an enforcing SELinux platform.

	* placeholder for additional notes for creating a systemd service

2022-11-30  Gulraj Rijhwani  <gdr+radioclkd@courtfields.com>

	* radioclkd.c: foreground running option added, inline debugging code 
	added and subsequently commented out; corrected to run on 64 bit 
	architecture

2003-01-20  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: stricter testing of received WWVB code for errors
	reject received times that differ by 1000 secs from system time

	* radioclkd.1: removed references to WWVB decoding being untested
	added note about lockups with PPS kit and the DCD line

2003-01-19  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: fixed WWVB decoding so it works against a real signal
	set timezone to UTC in testing mode so timestamps are actually UTC
	changed CalculatePPSAverage to use 59 samples and fixed indexing bug
	made sure clockInfo struct is properly reset at all appropriate points

2002-11-16  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c:
	use own replacement for mktime(), so logs are in the local time

2002-10-25  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.1: merged Debian patches to the manpage for DSR line

2002-10-24  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: fixed bugs in decoding of cts and dsr signals

2002-10-17  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: added pulse time averaging for improved performance
	now decodes third clock on DSR as well

2002-04-13  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: inital dual receiver decoding version

2002-04-10  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: fixed array indexing bug in DecodeMSF

2002-03-31  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c:
	fixed DCF77 and MSF decoders to deal with daylight savings

2002-03-19  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c:
	make sure only one copy of radioclkd is running at any one time

2002-03-16  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.1:
	take account of the fact two clocks can be handled on the one serial port

2002-03-12  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: really fixed DCF77 decoding this time
	backed out putting timestamps with LEAP_NOTINSYNC

2002-03-05  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c:
	put timestamp with LEAP_NOTINSYNC on error to reduce log noise

2002-03-04  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.1: removed references to DCF77 code being untested

	* radioclkd.c: fixed decoding of the DCF77 signal so it actually works

2002-02-08  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.1: removed references to selecting radio clock type
	added details of how to delete the shared memory segment

	* radioclkd.c:
	switched to using time_t internally to pass the time around

2002-02-04  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: added autodetection of which time code is being received
	converted WWVB decoding to more compact method

2002-02-01  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: new more compact decoding routines for DCF77 and MSF
	some bug fixes in PutTimeStamp

2002-01-30  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.1: New file.

2002-01-29  Jonathan Buzzard  <jab@jelly>

	* radioclkd.c: New file.
