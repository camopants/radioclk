radioclk for Debian
-------------------

Radioclkd will provide service to your ntpd process only if you tell
ntpd about it. To do this, you must include the line

	server 127.127.28.0

in /etc/ntpd.conf.

Also, it may be useful to add a line to /etc/ntpd.conf such as

	fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.0185 refid MSF

to correct for offset errors (using time1), and to change the displayed
reference clock ID (using refid).
