Template: radioclk/configure_ntp
Type: note
Description: You must configure your NTP server.
 Radioclkd will provide service to your ntpd process only if you tell
 ntpd about it. To do this, you must include the line
  server 127.127.28.0
 in /etc/ntpd.conf. Alternatively, you can use "dpkg-reconfigure
 ntp-refclock" to do the same thing.
 .
 Also, it may be useful to add a line to /etc/ntpd.conf such as
  fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.0185 refid MSF
 to correct for offset errors, and to change the displayed reference
 clock ID.
